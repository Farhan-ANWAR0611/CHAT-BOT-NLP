# CHAT-BOT-NLP
# 🎓 Student Performance Predictor Bot

This project is a capstone implementation of a machine learning-based chatbot designed to predict student performance levels (High, Medium, Low) based on their academic and demographic features.

## 🚀 Project Overview

Using a dataset from Kaggle, we trained a machine learning model to classify students into performance levels. The project includes:

- Data preprocessing and EDA
- Model training and evaluation
- Gradio-based chatbot interface for live prediction
- Fully Colab-compatible Python code

## 📂 Dataset

The dataset used (`StudentsPerformance01.csv`) contains student records with features such as:

- Gender
- Race/Ethnicity
- Parental Education Level
- Lunch Type
- Test Preparation Course
- Math, Reading, Writing Scores

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn
- Gradio (for web UI)
- Google Colab (for development)

## 🧠 Model

A Random Forest Classifier was used to predict student performance based on preprocessed input features.

## 🌐 How to Use

1. Clone the repo or open the notebook in Google Colab.
2. Run all cells to train the model.
3. Launch the Gradio interface to input student data and get a performance prediction.


## 📌 Project Goal

To demonstrate the use of machine learning and conversational AI in the education sector for performance analysis and prediction.
